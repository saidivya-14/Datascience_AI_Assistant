## 🔧 *How to Run the Project*
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- Install the following libraries:
1. streamlit
2. google-generativeai
You will also need to obtain an API key from Google to interact with the Gemini API.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-ai-assistant.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   bash
   cd data-science-ai-assistant
3. Install the required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up your Gemini API key (replace it in the app.py file):
   bash
   ai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
5. Run the Streamlit app:
   bash
   streamlit run app.py
6. Enter a data science-related query and receive an instant response.

## 📝 **Example Query**
plaintext
User Input: "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"
AI Response: "Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns to predict the output based on the input data. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves finding hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs."

## 🌟 **Future Enhancements**
- Expand Topics: Support more domains of AI/ML beyond data science.
- User Authentication: Implement user login for a personalized experience.
- Improved Responses: Enhance the AI's response quality using fine-tuning.
